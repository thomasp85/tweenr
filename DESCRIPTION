Description: In order to create smooth animation between states of data,
    tweening is necessary. This package provides a range of functions for
    creating tweened data that can be used as basis for animation. Furthermore 
    it adds a number of vectorized interpolaters for common R data 
    types such as numeric, date and colour.
